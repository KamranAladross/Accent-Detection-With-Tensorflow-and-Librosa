# Accent Detection With Tensorflow and Librosa
Senior Project To Detect Accent Using Tensorflow and Librosa

This project was done using Windows 10 with a Nvidia GTX860M graphics card. 
You can accomplish the same using a computer without a graphics card by downloading the CPU version of Tensorflow. However, note that with the CPU version, it will take much longer for Tensorflow to build your models.
## Step 1
First we need to install Python 3.5.x
Go to 
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-amd64-webinstall.exe
and download and install python.
Then, open up the command prompt and type:

python -V

conda create -n tensorflow
activate tensorflow
python -V
conda list
conda install python=3.5.2
conda install -c conda-forge librosa

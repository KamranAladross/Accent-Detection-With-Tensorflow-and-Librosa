# Accent Detection With Tensorflow and Librosa
Senior Project To Detect Accent Using Tensorflow and Librosa

This project was done using Windows 10 with a Nvidia GTX860M graphics card. 
You can accomplish the same using a computer without a graphics card by downloading the CPU version of Tensorflow.
## Step 1
First we need to install Python 3.5.x
conda create -n tensorflow
activate tensorflow
python -V
conda list
conda install python=3.5.2
conda install -c conda-forge librosa
